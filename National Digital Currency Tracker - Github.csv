1,Australia,Research,"The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is actively exploring the use of a wholesale eAUD. To that end, the RBA conducted a proof of concept to simulate a wholesale settlement system involving commercial banks in the country. The RBA is committed to continue this research throughout 2020 to ascertain the viability of a digital Australian dollar. ","In a December 2019 paper, the RBA echoed warnings from other central banks about the need to thoroughly study downside risks of CBDC for financial stability. At this point, the bank argued that a wholesale CBDC holds more promise than a retail version, given ample availability of digital money that households are already using. Thus, the RBA set-up an innovation lab to research a wholesale settlement system based on a “private, permissioned Ethereum network.” During the proof-of-concept the RBA simulated issuing tokens to commercial banks, having those banks exchange the tokens, and ultimately redeeming the tokens. The RBA is considering partnering with external stakeholders to continue studying how a wholesale CBDC might help the bank to better fulfill its mandate.

4,Cambodia,Development,The National Bank of Cambodia has developed and deployed the first batch of its CBDC as part of “Project Bakong”.,"In July 2019, NBC tested Project Bakong, a real time interbank payments system with its own digital currency. Today, the system links 11 domestic commercial banks and payments processors, although the NBC plans to build out cross-border capabilities. In October, NBC signed an agreement with a Malaysion bank to begin experimenting with digital wallets for cross-border transactions. 

Developed in partnership with Soramitsu, a Japanese fintech firm, Bakong is designed to allow end users to set up a wallet connected to their bank accounts. Bakong wallets will exchange fiat currency to the new CBDC and facilitate real time payments between all users connected to the network. The NBC will store centralized records of transactions. 

The NBC is primarily motivated by financial inclusion, in a country where the vast majority of citizens are unbanked but where mobile penetration rates are increasing dramatically. In addition, Cambodia has a severely underdeveloped payments system with no real-time payments capabilities in the interbank network or between merchants and banks. Bakong explores blockchain-based payments technology as a solution to both modernize and expand the reach of the system.

5,Canada,Development,"The Bank of Canada currently harbors no plans to launch a digital currency. However, it maintains an initiative to build the capability to launch a national digital currency should the need arise. This is part of a broader strategy for the Bank of Canada to fulfil its mandate and address any possible developments with regards to the future of payments and money.","Canada’s digital currency initiative is one among a portfolio of contingencies to adapt to any possible scenario, and prepare for the future of money and payments. According to the Bank of Canada, it would consider launching a digital currency if “the use of bank notes were to decline to a point where Canadians no longer had the option of using them for a wide range of transactions;” or a competing digital currency were to become a widespread alternative to the Canadian dollar. 
 
On November 15th, 2018, the Bank of Canada, Bank of England, and Monetary Authority of Singapore jointly published a report examining alternative models for cross-border transactions. The report looked at three models, one of which used Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency, and concluded “the models could be used to improve access, speed and transparency of cross-border payments.”

6,China,Pilot,"In April 2020, China became the world first major economy to pilot a digital currency. People's Bank of China are aiming for widespread domestic use of the DC/EP by the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.","Since 2014, The People's Bank of China has established a special research group on legal digital currency to demonstrate the feasibility of the central bank issuing legal digital currency. China launched a project called Digital Currency/Electronic Payments, or “DC/EP”, in 2017, amid a wider push to develop its high-technology sectors. Chinese officials described the currency as having “controllable anonymity”, giving the government far-reaching powers to identify money laundering and other illicit activity. Chinese leaders may also be seeking to reduce reliance on U.S. financial institutions and oversight.

The DC/EP project accelerated in 2019 when Facebook introduced Libra. “If Libra is accepted by everyone and becomes a widely used payment tool, then after some time, it is entirely possible that it will develop into a global, super-sovereign currency,” according to Mu Changchun, Director of PBoC Digital Currency Research Institute. “We need to plan ahead to protect our monetary sovereignty.”

In April 2020, China piloted the digital currency in four cities, allowing commercial banks to run internal tests like conversions between cash and digital money, account-balance checks, and payments. The digital currency is expected to formally launch later in 2020, and replace significant portions of physical cash in circulation by 2022.

Widely mistrusted by citizens, the DE accounted for less than .003% of currency in circulation in 2016 and was abolished by the National Assembly in December 2017.","In 2014 the government of Ecuador, announced that the Ecuadorian Central Bank (BCE) would begin issuing the dinero electrónico, or DE. By February 2015, users could keep account balances on the central bank's balance sheet and transfer them using a mobile phone app, provided by a state-owned mobile phone company, CNT. 

Ecuador ""dollarized"" its monetary system in 2000, and the DE was intended to be a claim against the government's U.S. dollar reserves. However, given the government defaulted on sovereign dollar-denominated bonds in 2008, the DE was not perceived to be as safe as deposits held in commercial banks. Further, the DE was widely viewed as a way for the government to gain monopoly profits, since only the state-owned company could provide mobile payments services.

In 2016, the value of all DE in circulation was less than $800,000 (0.003% of the monetary liabilities of the Ecuadorian financial system) with only 1,100 transactions per day. In December 2017, Ecuador’s National Assembly passed legislation to abolish the central bank electronic money system and outsource e-payment systems to private banks.
