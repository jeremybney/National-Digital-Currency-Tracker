Widely mistrusted by citizens, the DE accounted for less than .003% of currency in circulation in 2016 and was abolished by the National Assembly in December 2017.","In 2014 the government of Ecuador, announced that the Ecuadorian Central Bank (BCE) would begin issuing the dinero electrónico, or DE. By February 2015, users could keep account balances on the central bank's balance sheet and transfer them using a mobile phone app, provided by a state-owned mobile phone company, CNT. 

Ecuador ""dollarized"" its monetary system in 2000, and the DE was intended to be a claim against the government's U.S. dollar reserves. However, given the government defaulted on sovereign dollar-denominated bonds in 2008, the DE was not perceived to be as safe as deposits held in commercial banks. Further, the DE was widely viewed as a way for the government to gain monopoly profits, since only the state-owned company could provide mobile payments services.

In 2016, the value of all DE in circulation was less than $800,000 (0.003% of the monetary liabilities of the Ecuadorian financial system) with only 1,100 transactions per day. In December 2017, Ecuador’s National Assembly passed legislation to abolish the central bank electronic money system and outsource e-payment systems to private banks.

5,Amanda,Canada,CAN,Development,"The Bank of Canada currently harbors no plans to launch a digital currency. However, it maintains an initiative to build the capability to launch a national digital currency should the need arise. This is part of a broader strategy for the Bank of Canada to fulfill its mandate and address any possible developments with regards to the future of payments and money.","Canada’s digital currency initiative is one among a portfolio of contingencies to adapt to any possible scenario, and prepare for the future of money and payments. According to the Bank of Canada, it would consider launching a digital currency if “the use of bank notes were to decline to a point where Canadians no longer had the option of using them for a wide range of transactions;” or a competing digital currency were to become a widespread alternative to the Canadian dollar. 

In early December, Timothy Lane, the Bank of Canada deputy governor in charge of financial technology, stated that COVID-19 may expedite Canada’s need for a CBDC. The pandemic has accelerated the move towards a digital economy, and less widespread cash usage indicates that a fundamental shift may occur sooner than anticipated. However, the Bank of Canada still does not have a concrete timeline for launch.
 
On November 15th, 2018, the Bank of Canada, Bank of England, and Monetary Authority of Singapore jointly published a report examining alternative models for cross-border transactions. The report looked at three models, one of which used Wholesale Central Bank Digital Currency, and concluded “the models could be used to improve access, speed and transparency of cross-border payments.”

People's Bank of China are aiming for widespread domestic use of the DC/EP by the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.","In 2014, the People's Bank of China established a special research group to demonstrate the feasibility of the central bank issuing legal digital currency. China launched a project called Digital Currency/Electronic Payments, or “DC/EP” in 2017, amid a wider push to develop its high-technology sectors. Chinese officials described the currency as having “controllable anonymity”, giving the government far-reaching powers to identify money laundering and other illicit activity. Chinese leaders may also be seeking to reduce reliance on U.S. financial institutions and oversight.

The DC/EP project accelerated in 2019 when Facebook introduced Libra. “If Libra is accepted by everyone and becomes a widely used payment tool, then after some time, it is entirely possible that it will develop into a global, super-sovereign currency,” according to Mu Changchun, Director of PBoC Digital Currency Research Institute. “We need to plan ahead to protect our monetary sovereignty.”

In April 2020, China piloted the digital currency in four cities, allowing commercial banks to run internal tests like conversions between cash and digital money, account-balance checks, and payments. The piloted program expanded to 28 major cities in August. Aiming for broad circulation in 2022, China plans to pilot the digital currency in major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai in early 2021.","Wholesale, Retail",Didi Chuxing,UTXO Mode/Centralized Ledger,"Yao Qian, Former Director of PBoC Digital Currency Research Institute

27,Amanda,"Hong Kong, SAR",HKG,Pilot,"In January of 2020, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) jointly published with the Bank of Thailand a study on the application of central bank digital currencies for cross-border payments. The HKMA and Bank of Thailand developed a cross-border corridor network allowing participating banks to conduct peer-to-peer foreign exchange transactions. This was titled Project Inthanon-LionRock and was deemed a success. HKMA and BoT signed a contract with ConsenSys to conduct cross border transactions in September of 2020, and are now working on a proof of concept. The project was retitled the Multiple CBDC Bridge (or 'mBridge') in February 2021 when it was joined by Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates and the Digital Currency Institute of the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), supported by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). The BIS reported that the first pilot phase of the expanded mCBDC project was a success, demonstrating that cross-border settlement using CBDCs has benefits over the traditional cash correspondent banking model in terms of speed, availability, and cost. Future phases of the pilot scheme will further explore privacy, liquidity, scalability and regulatory compliance, while extending participation in trials to commercial banks and other market participants. HKMA’s CEO also announced in December 2020 that HKMA is discussing a cross-border pilot program for the digital yuan in collaboration with China. In October 2021, the HKMA published a white paper and Request for Comments discussing the potential applications for a possible 'e-HKD' for retail purposes and seeking industry views. The paper discusses various technical design considerations and policy matters such as privacy, compliance (including privacy-preserving traceability of transactions), interoperability, scalability, cybersecurity, and resilience. ","The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has been actively engaging in public-private partnerships to research the potential applications of a digital currency. As early as April 2017, the HKMA had been working with banks, distributed ledger startup R3, and Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited to research the feasibility of digital currencies as a payment system. This would later be coined Project LionRock, and concluded that digital currencies have significant potential for financial institutions making interbank payments and cross-border payments.

Project LionRock developed into a joint project with the Bank of Thailand, Project Inthanon-LionRock, when both parties signed a memorandum of understanding in May of 2019 to study the application of cross-border payments. The study developed a cross-border network corridor, which allowed for Thai and Hong Kong banks to conduct foreign exchange transactions on a peer-to-peer basis. The findings were published on January 22nd, 2020 and concluded that the project achieved its intended objectives, with Hong Kong hoping to expand the project to more central banks. In September 2020, ConsenSys won the contract for the cross-border payment system between Hong Kong and Thailand. The project is now in its second stage, intended to explore “specific business applications as well as the operability and scalability of the platform to allow the participation of three or more CBDCs.” 

In November 2019, the HKMA also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Institute of Digital Currency, a subsidiary of the People’s Bank of China. The aim of this project was to create a proof of concept in the first quarter of 2020 linking their two trade finance platforms. 

In December 2020, Eddie Yue, Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, announced that HKMA is discussing a technical pilot of the e-CNY or digital yuan with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) for making cross-border payments, and are “making the corresponding technical preparations.”

The Bank of Korea has continued to reiterate throughout the process that this pilot program does not necessarily guarantee they will launch a digital won.

To that end, the RBA conducted a proof of concept to simulate a wholesale settlement system involving commercial banks in the country. The RBA is committed to continue this research throughout 2020 to ascertain the viability of a digital Australian dollar, and has partnered with Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank, Perpetual and ConsenSys Software.","In a December 2019 paper, the RBA echoed warnings from other central banks about the need to thoroughly study downside risks of CBDC for financial stability. At this point, the bank argued that a wholesale CBDC holds more promise than a retail version, given ample availability of digital money that households are already using. Thus, the RBA set-up an innovation lab to research a wholesale settlement system based on a “private, permissioned Ethereum network.” During the proof-of-concept the RBA simulated issuing tokens to commercial banks, having those banks exchange the tokens, and ultimately redeeming the tokens. The RBA is considering partnering with external stakeholders to continue studying how a wholesale CBDC might help the bank to better fulfill its mandate. 

RBA announced in November 2020 that they have partnered with Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank, Perpetual and ConsenSys Software to “explore the potential use and implications of a wholesale form of central bank digital currency (CBDC) using distributed ledger technology (DLT).” This partnership will involve the creation of a proof-of-concept “for the issuance of a tokenized form of CBDC that can be used by wholesale market participants for the funding, settlement and repayment of a tokenized syndicated loan on an Ethereum-based DLT platform.”

The project should have ended at the end of 2020 and a report on the findings is expected to be published by mid-2021.

66,Jeremy / Eve,USA,USA,Research,"The United States has lagged most G10 economies in exploring a digital currency. The Federal Reserve is in the very early stages of research, while interest within Congress to establish a digital dollar is growing. In August 2020, the Fed announced a collaboration with MIT researchers to build and test a digital currency for central bank uses.","The Fed has thus far been cautious and slow. In a testimony to Congress in February 2020, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, “[I]t may be many more years before the Fed reveals any details of its research and development on a digital dollar to date, as we hope there would be many rounds of public consultation before any kind of official announcement or rollout.”

However, progress by Facebook, China, and other G10 economies may intensify the Fed’s efforts to take a greater role in shaping the global payments system. Fed Governor Lael Brainard has noted that, “Given the dollar's important role, it is essential that we remain on the frontier of research and policy development regarding CBDC...We are collaborating with other central banks as we advance our understanding of central bank digital currencies.” 

Congressional interest in establishing a digital dollar has also grown amid COVID-19. Notably, Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) introduced the Banking for All Act in March 2020 that would create a retail “digital wallet” for all Americans. Given technological challenges and subsequent delays in delivering stimulus payments to millions of American households and taxpayers, lawmakers are exploring the digital dollar as a means to promote financial inclusion and a more efficient payments system. In May 2020, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's research department has published a new working paper addressed on CBDC, which explored the transformative implications for the make-up of the financial insititutions.

In a speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco's Innovation Office Hours in August 2020, Federal Reserve Board Governor Lael Brainard announced several updates on digital currencies, including an existing multidisciplinary team ""studying the implications of digital currencies on the payments ecosystem, monetary policy, financial stability, banking and finance, and consumer protection,"" a collaboration between the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and MIT researchers to test ""a hypothetical digital currency oriented to central bank uses,"" and an initiative with the Bank of International Settlement's Innovation Hub for ""increased cooperation and exchange"" with other central banks.
